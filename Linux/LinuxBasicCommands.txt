kill all processes starting with cupsd using
sudo killall cupsd

kill all dave's processes using
sudo pkill -u dave 

set niceness i.e. priority using
nice -n -20 [processID or pathtofile.ext] (for super high priority)
sudo renice -5 [processID or pathtofile.ext] (for a bit less priority)

get first word of file using
cat filename | cut -d " " -f1

check /proc/ for mega details on all processes ... "the matrix itself"

check out strace

ps -aux | grep udevd

ifconfig

list what is mounted using
df -ah

check out man hier(archy)

everything begins at root, then you have bin(ary) for base OS commands, 

output here if don't want to see on console

if forgot to enter vim as superuser, exit with this so do't have to recreate entire file
:w !sudo tee % > /dev/null

Other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications.
